# Ecosystem: AI-Assisted Development With Verification (AADV)

## Abstract

As a developer community, we don't agree about the viability of LLMs to produce production-worthy code. To make things worse, some headstrong developers are charging forward with little more than (what they hope to be good) vibes. Yet we know that LLMs hallucinate, and we know that they produce low-quality code. We also know that it's a bad idea to trust our ability to gate defects solely via reading or *manually* testing code.

We can do better than coding on vibes alone. Learn about AADV, a simple but disciplined example-driven approach for generating code with an LLM. In this session, you'll see live demonstrations of generating code using an LLM. You'll be able to try the concepts behind AADV yourself the moment you leave the session.

Outline of the session:

* What you get from an LLM when exuding (bad) vibes
* The prime directive for generating code with AI
* The Create-Assess-eXecute (CAX) cycle
* Providing examples & vetting tests
* Improving quality with a style
* Design still matters

Indeed, you will still matter in the near-future of AI, as will most of your design and development skills. And you'll still have fun with it.

## Speaker

My name is Jeff Langr, and I've been developing software professionally since 1982. I've written five books on software development, and am a co-author of Robert Martin's best-selling software development book Clean Code (including the upcoming 2nd edition). I've been exploring the realities and limitations of LLM-generated code since fall 2023, and have begun sharing my learnings through the substack [AI Code Correct](https://jjlangr.substack.gom).

## How to get involved

You are welcome to join the conversation at my Substack, and help shape the future of responsible AI-assisted software development. The AADV process is simple and doesn't require extensive tooling, but we could streamling things with IDE plugins to help manage example sets and process the results. You can also contact me directly at jeff@langrsoft.com.

## Learning Recommendation

The beauty of AADV is that you can practice it using only your IDE and a chat interface (such as ChatGPT). Try it out on your favorite katas, or even try to apply it to your real programming challenges.

I've written a good number of articles on AADV at my Substack as well (and most are free for subscribers).

You can also lean on other learners in my Substack's chat.
